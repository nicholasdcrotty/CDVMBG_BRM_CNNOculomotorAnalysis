# CDVMBG_BRM_CNNOculomotorAnalysis
This repository contains the scripts for a CNN-based analysis of time-course oculomotor data, as described in Crotty, Doyle, Volkova, Massa, Benson, &amp; Grubb (in prep).

**NOTE:** All associated data (*e.g.*, the oculomotor data to which we applied the networks, the behavioral data utilized in the SHAP value - RT comparisons, and the files for the results reported in the manuscript) are freely available at the following link: **LINK**. Due to Github file size constraints, these files couldn't be included in the current repo.

### ``analysisForReplication``: 
This folder contains all of the analysis scripts (as .ipynb files) we utilized to produce the results reported in the manuscript.

### ``analysisForUser``: 
This folder contains a script (as a .ipynb file) designed to be a framework for users to apply our approach to their own data.

### ``Rscripts``
This folder contains all of the .R files we used for the statistical interpretation of the CNN results, as well as the summary files for the Bayesian models.
