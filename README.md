# CMBG_BRM_CNNOculomotorAnalysis
This repository contains the scripts for a CNN-based analysis of time-course oculomotor data, as described in Crotty, Massa, Benson, &amp; Grubb (in prep).

**NOTE:** All associated data (*e.g.*, the oculomotor data to which we applied the networks and the files for the results reported in the manuscript) are freely available at the following link: **LINK**. Due to Github file size constraints, these files couldn't be included in the current repo.

## analysisForReplication: 
This folder contains all of the analysis scripts (as .ipynb files) we utilized to produce the results reported in the manuscript.

## analysisForUser: 
This folder contains a script (as a .ipynb file) designed to be a framework for users to apply our approach to their own data.
