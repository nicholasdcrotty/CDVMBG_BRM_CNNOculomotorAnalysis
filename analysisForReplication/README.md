## ``CDVMBG_BRM_CNNBasedAnalysis_ForReplication.ipynb``
This script conducts the CNN-based analysis 

## ``CDVMBG_BRM_ModelGeneralizability.ipynb``
This script conducts the assessment of model generalizability, in which the network trained on the Massa *et al.* (2024) dataset is applied to the eye traces from Doyle *et al.* (2025)
